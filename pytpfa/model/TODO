[] Confirm correctness of the current implementation
[] Change DOF logic to use PETSc Section and Fields (https://petsc.org/main/manual/section/) (NOT POSSIBLE NOWs)
[] Use the fields to add the Boundary Conditions (https://petsc.org/release/manualpages/DM/DMAddBoundary) (NOT POSSIBLE NOWs)
[] Change .ini aproach to support passing analytical solutions and boundary conditions
[] Use hdf5 to cache the DMStag in the folder examples/example_tpfa/$CUR_EXAMPLE/cache
[] Change test_tpfa to execute over all specified examples in the command
[] Change well logic to use cartesian coordinates over the domain instead of grid
[] Change test_tpfa logic to:
    - Parse options to select the example, define logging configuration, define optimization configurations, define refinment of mesh and starting values
    - Run the example
    - Load the info for the example for each time step:
        - Total times (preprocessing, solve, update)
        - Total MPI messages
        - Total allocated memory
        - Values of pressure on each time step
    - Use the pressure values to assert correctness and calculate the L2 error
    - Plot graphs of time over each refinemnt, iteration speedup and other performance related metrics
